# CRM Project Rules
- **Stack:** Google Apps Script + GitHub Actions.
- **Syncing:** Always use `clasp` naming conventions (no spaces in filenames).
- **GitHub Workflow:** All features should be developed on branches, never directly on `main`.
- **Formatting:** Use Prettier for HTML and standard GAS style for .gs files.
